# LinuxFun
Some really stupid and funny commands for debian-based linux
## Installation
Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/amorinn/FunLinux.git
```
Then:
```
cd /FunLinux

sudo bash ./install.sh
```
If you have a **bash shell**:
```
cat alias >> ~/.bashrc
```
If you have a **Zsh shell**:
```
cat alias >> ~/.zshrc

(You can do both if you aren not sure)
And it's redy to go!

## Usage
### Donkey
Just type ```donkey``` or ```funlinux -d``` to have a donkey in your terminal.

### Amongus
With this command you can print a amongus crewmate, and you decide if is impostor or not (is totally random btw).\
To use type ```amongus``` or ```funlinux -a```.

### Undertale
Use this command to have a text with typing effect with the voice of sans from undertale,
If u edit */bin/funlinux/*, uncomment the undertale section, and you type the path of your UNDERTALE.exe, you can have a great effect for opening undertale

### Waifu
Displays a picture from */usr/local/share/funlinux/waifu* you can add or remove any image even if it isn't a waifu,\there ara some defaults just for the memes\
To use it just type ```waifu``` or ```funlinux -w```.\
(There is no image)

### Hentai
I would be very dissapointed if you use this command, ```hentai``` or ```funlinux -h```.
God is Watching you.\
(There is no image too)
